# randomShapesGenerator

This is a program I developed for an art project which was about the theme "Drawing machine", as I was learning how to develop in Python, I thought it could be cool to realise this project in Python.

## How to use

Use the functon art() with 2 parameters :
- Number of turns (the number of shapes that will be drawn)
- The shape that will be drawn : 
    - 0 = Circle, example :
        - ![program with triangles](https://github.com/RomainLAU/randomShapesGenerator/screenshots/circles.png)    
    - 1 = Triangle
    - 2 = Square
    - 3 = Parallelepiped

## Modules used

I used 1 graphic module to achieve the project: [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)
